  This is a modern Single Page Application (SPA) 
  built using the React library. It communicates 
  with a backend server for data and business    
  logic.

  Core Architecture:

   * Frontend Framework: React is used to build the
     user interface with a component-based       
     structure.
   * Build Tool & Dev Server: Vite is used for its
     fast development server and for bundling the
     application for production.
   * Routing: React Router (react-router) manages
     client-side navigation, allowing for different
     pages and views (like Home.jsx, Products.jsx)
     without reloading the entire page. The main 
     routing logic is likely configured in       
     src/router/Router.jsx.
   * State Management: Redux Toolkit
     (@reduxjs/toolkit) is used for centralized  
     state management. This includes a global store
     (src/redux/app/store.js) and feature-based  
     "slices" (e.g.,
     src/redux/app/features/cart/cartSlice.js) to
     manage different parts of the application's 
     state.
   * Data Fetching & Caching: RTK Query, which is
     part of Redux Toolkit, is the primary       
     mechanism for fetching and caching data from a
      backend API. It uses a declarative approach
     to define API endpoints.
       * The src/redux/app/services directory    
         contains the API "slices" for different 
         data models (products, orders, users,   
         etc.).
       * It uses Axios as the underlying HTTP    
         client, as configured in
         src/redux/app/services/axiosBaseQuery.js.
   * Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for styling,  
     providing a utility-first approach to design
     the UI.

  Main Components Identified:

   * React & React DOM: The core of the user     
     interface.
   * Vite: The engine for building and serving the
     application.
   * React Router: Handles all client-side       
     navigation.
   * Redux Toolkit (RTK & RTK Query): The backbone
     for state management and API communication. 
   * Component Hierarchy:
       * `pages`: Top-level components representing
         individual pages (e.g., About.jsx,      
         Checkout.jsx).
       * `components`: Reusable UI elements,     
         organized by function (shared, Home, ui).
   * Axios: The HTTP client used by the data     
     fetching layer to make requests to the      
     backend.

        * Component-Based Architecture: This is the   
     fundamental pattern of React. The UI is broken
     down into reusable and independent components.
     You can see this in the src/components      
     directory, with shared components, and      
     page-specific components. App.jsx serves as the
     root component that composes the main layout.

   * Centralized State Management: The project uses
     Redux Toolkit for state management. The     
     src/redux/app/store.js file configures a    
     central store for the entire application. This
     pattern is useful for managing application  
     state that is shared across multiple        
     components, such as the contents of the     
     shopping cart (cartSlice.js).

   * Service Layer (API Layer): The application uses
     RTK Query to create a dedicated service layer
     for interacting with the backend API. In    
     src/redux/app/services/, you can see API slices
     like productApi.js and orderApi.js. This pattern
      encapsulates the logic for making API requests
     and caching the responses, separating it from
     the UI components. The components can then use
     hooks like useGetAllProductQuery to fetch data.


   * Higher-Order Component (HOC): The withAuth.jsx
     and withPublic.jsx files in src/utils are   
     Higher-Order Components. These are functions
     that take a component and return a new component
      with additional props or behavior. In this 
     case, they are used to protect routes and manage
      authentication logic, a common use case for
     HOCs. For example, the Checkout page is wrapped
     with withAuth to ensure only authenticated users
      can access it.

   * Routing: The application uses React Router for
     client-side routing. The src/router/Router.jsx
     file defines all the application's routes,  
     mapping URL paths to specific components. This
     creates a single-page application (SPA)     
     experience where navigating between pages   
     doesn't require a full page reload.

   * Modular/Feature-Sliced Design: The Redux logic
     is organized by features (e.g., cart) and   
     services (e.g., product, user). This is a form
     of modular design that helps to keep the    
     codebase organized and scalable. Each feature or
      service is responsible for a specific domain of
      the application.

  In summary, the codebase leverages a modern set of
   design patterns common in React applications to
  create a scalable, maintainable, and efficient 
  single-page application.
